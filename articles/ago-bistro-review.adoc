= AGO Bistro Review

[docdate]#Written by Enoch Tsang on Sept 11, 2022#

The link:https://ago.ca[Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO)] has its very own restaurant within it, dutifully named, the link:https://ago.ca/dine/ago-bistro[AGO Bistro].
My wife and I had explored the AGO itself for the afternoon, which we had a wonderful time at, and decided to end off the day with a meal at the AGO Bistro.
The restaurant was nice and modern, similar to the rest of the building.
We were quickly seated by the friendly staff and had our orders quickly taken after reviewing their short and simple menu.

Their main menu item was a $30 brunch combo which would come with tea or coffee, a starter, and a main.
We both had that and got tea.
For the tea, they had an interesting multicultural selection to choose from.

== Dishes

=== Chicken Liver Pâté - AMAZING

The meal started off bright as this was our first starter.
The components left to right were watercress, ontario fruit preserve, the pâté, and some crostini.

I started off by eating each component by itself and was hit by the severe bitterness of the watercress and sweetness of the fruit preserve.
I assume those two are meant to be eaten together, because after I had them in unison the balance was astoundingly perfect.

The star of the show, the pâté, was given in generous amount and really let the key ingredient shine.
The classic liver flavour was very strong and it was well seasoned so as to compliment but not overpower that flavour.
The crostini was hard enough to serve as a proper bed for a spread and just sweet enough to correctly compliment the strong flavour of the pâté.

I could not imagine the flavours having been done any better.
I also do not have pâté often, and the combination of the watercress and fruit preserve was surprising, thus earning an *AMAZING* from me.

=== Grapefruit Salad - BAD

This was a mix of ruby grapefruit, shaved fennel, mint, pickled finger chili, and olive oil.

Honestly, I'm not sure what they were trying to do here, when I was eating this my whole mouth was just filled with sour and bitterness.
There wasn't any balance as I saw in the pâté.

I think the dish would've been greatly improved by some stronger flavoured vegetables (like spinach) and some sweet dressing to balance out the grapefruit.

I'm also not a huge fan of grapefruit so perhaps someone who loves grapefruit would've enjoyed this dish.

=== Ago Burger - GREAT

This was a pleasure to eat and had all the hearty constructions of a good burger.
The meat was cooked perfectly and was gorgeously complimented by the rest of the ingredients.
The fries had the perfect consistency, cut small as to be crispy but not mushy in the middle.
I think I would've liked the fries to be seasoned a bit more and the garlic aioli to be a little bit lighter.

But the *GREAT* is given to the wonderfully architected burger.

=== Longanisa Silog - GOOD

I have a policy that I will always order the special if there is one, I would hope that the special is... special!
This traditionally Filipino dish was the special at the time and was advertised as a promotion of multicultural celebration.

The Longanisa (the sausage) was very tasty, it had a fun balance of savouriness and sweetness.
The garlic rice was also delightfully surprising to me.
I regularly have rice but rarely flavoured.
So the bonus flavour, which was well-executed, to something I already enjoyed was well received.

The pico (which sat on top of the rice) and the atchara pickles I would say had too much vinegar for my tastes.
I would've preferred the vinegar to act as more of a compliment to the vegetables rather than it showing up as the main flavour.

The eggs themselves were alright, pretty standard fried eggs.
At this price point, I think I'm expecting a bit of seasoning to go on the eggs.

== Final Verdict - GOOD

The meal did not disappoint but I would say was probably not worth the cost.
For that kind of price point I'm looking for something I would rank as *GREAT* across the board.
