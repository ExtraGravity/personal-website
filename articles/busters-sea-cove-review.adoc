My wife and I went to the original link:https://www.bustersseacove.ca/[Buster's Sea Cove] which is nestled into the second floor of Toronto's link:http://www.stlawrencemarket.com/[St. Lawrence Market].
Everytime we went to the market, it had a long line up so I thought it must be good.
Despite the long line up, it didn't take me long to get to the front to order and get my food.
Their system was very efficient and was one of the few restaurants in the market to have ample dedicated seating.
I'll be rating the food here based on my 5-tier system, which you can read about on my link:/reviews[reviews] page.

== Dishes

=== East Coast Lobster Roll with Fries

Lobster is my favourite kind of seafood so I was really looking forward to this.
Unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations.
The minced lobster itself was well-seasoned but nothing spectacular, so I got to enjoy the lobster flavour I always love.
I think the whole dish did not come together very much as a roll though.
The bun was soft but I think could've been a little sweeter to compliment the saltiness of the lobster.
It also needed a bit of sauce like mayonnaise or tartar sauce to kind of glue all the flavours together.
The fries were thin-cut the way I like, but were flimsy, indicating they were old.
Despite the shortcomings, they still let the flavour of the lobster shine though, earning a *GOOD* from me.

=== Seafood Orzo Pasta

The strengths and weaknesses of the pasta were opposite of the lobster roll.
The pasta itself was perfectly cooked.
I think they also picked the perfect shape to pair with seafood, the small bite-sized pieces let you have both in one mouthful.
The squid was perfectly cooked but the mussels were not fully open, so I think a bit under.
The biggest problem was that the sauce did not compliment the seafood.
The tartness of the tomato sauce completely overpowered the seafood and hid all the wonderful flavours of the mussels and squid.

Each of the individual components were quite tasty and had great texture, but they failed to all come together in harmony, resulting in a rating of *OK* from me.

== Final Verdict: OK
