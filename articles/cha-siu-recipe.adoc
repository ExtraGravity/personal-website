= Cha Siu (叉燒) Recipe

[docdate]#Written by Enoch Tsang on August 15th, 2020#

Cha Siu (commonly spelt char siu) is a Chinese dish from the Canton region.
Normally it is roasted and marinated for a long period of time, but this recipe gets the same classic taste in an everyday kitchen.

== Ingredients

* Pork Shoulder (叉燒肉) - 2 lbs
* Cha Siu Sauce (叉燒醬) - 1/2 Cup
* Chinese Cooking Wine (低度厨用花彫酒) - 1 Tbsp
* White Pepper Powder (白胡椒粉) - 1 tsp
* Honey (蜜糖) - As needed (but won't be much)

=== Notes

Most of these ingredients will only be found in an Asian grocery store (such as T&T).
These specific brands were found in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
Asian grocery stores will likely have the meat labelled in Chinese specifically as 叉燒肉.
Other cuts of meat can be used, but the fattier the better.

== Tools Needed

* Basting Brush
* Oven with Broil Setting
* Saran Wrap
* Sharp Knife
* Small Bowl
* Fridge
* Tin Foil
* Baking Pan

== Directions

The recipe requires two days, the first day for marination and the second day for cooking.

=== Day 1

. Cut the meat in half (length-wise) as shown in the ingredients image.
This is so that the finished pieces will be bite-sized.
