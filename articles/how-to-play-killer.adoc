_Killer_ is a fast-paced game of deduction for medium sized groups.
One person is chosen to be the *killer*, one person the *doctor*, and everyone else a *townfolk*.
While the *killer* attempts to kill the entire town, the *doctor* revives people and the *townfolks* try to single out the *killer*.
The game takes about 5 minutes to explain and each round lasts about a minute.

Requirements:

* A deck of cards (doesn't need to be complete)
* 7-14 people
* A space where everyone can sit in a circle and hold hands

== How to Play

=== Setup

. Have everyone sit in a circle in a proximity where they can hold hands.
The hands must be able to be held in a non-visible place, such as under a table or behind a player's back.

. From the deck, pull out the the Jack of Diamonds, Ace of Hearts, and a black number card for every person remaining.
So for example with 9 players, 7 black number cards are needed; with 12 players, 10 are needed.

=== Round Start

. Shuffle the cards and deal one card face-down to each player, the card represents the player's identity.

* The Jack of Diamonds is the *killer*
* The Ace of Hearts is the *doctor*
* All the black number cards are *townfolk*

. Get each player to look at their card and memorize their identity.
After memorizing their identity, they keep the card face-down in front of them.

. Everyone should now hold hands and put their held hands in a non-visible location.
Easy non-visible locations include under a table or behind their backs.

. At this point, the game can begin.
To start the game, one person announces:

    The night has begun, killer you may begin killing...

=== Gameplay

==== Squeezing

During gameplay, every player will "pass on" squeezes.
If a player feels some number of squeezes, they should squeeze their other hand that _many times minus one_ to pass on the squeezes.

For example, if a player feels 4 squeezes on their right hand, they should squeeze their left hand 3 times.
If a player feels 2 squeezes on their left hand, they should squeeze their right hand once.

If a player feels a single squeeze, they should flip over their card.
If their card is face-up, that means they are dead and cannot say anything.

==== Accusing

If any of the townfolk have a hunch about who the *killer* is, they can accuse them by saying:
[quote]
    I accuse <name of the accussed>!

In order for any action to be taken on the accusation, someone else must say:
[quote]
    I agree with <name of the accuser>!

At which point, the accused will either say "yes" or "no".
If that person _is_ the *killer*, the game is over and the *townfolk* have won.
If that person _is not_ the *killer*, both the accusers die and flip over their cards.

Only townfolk who are alive can accuse people.

==== The *Killer* and the *Doctor*

To kill or revive people, the *killer* and the *doctor* start squeezes.
They must count the number of seats away their target is seated and squeeze that many times in that direction.

For example, if Mary, Jane, Tom, and Peter were all sitting in that order.
If Mary was the *killer* and wanted to kill Peter, she should squeeze 3 times in the direction of Peter.
Jane would squeeze twice, Tom would squeeze once, and Peter would feel just one squeeze and then flip over his card indicating his death.

The *doctor* works the same way except their goal is to revive people who have died.
The *doctor* can die as well.

==== Winning

The killer wins by killing everyone in the town.
Everyone else wins if the killer has been successfully accussed.
