= My Amazon Interview Experience

[docdate]#Written by Enoch Tsang on August 10th, 2022#

Around May 2022, I was starting to look for opportunities outside of my then company.
I had never tried to get into a big tech company before and thought I'd give it a shot.
Of the FAANG companies, I also applied to Google (with a referral), Facebook, and Apple.
Google sent me rejections after over a month.
Facebook never responded, although they did have a hiring freeze.
I only got a response from Apple, but it turned out the opening was in China and they needed me to relocate (which I was unwilling to do so).

But here I will chronicle my journey with Amazon, from applying, all the way to the offer.

== Application

After I ignored many messages from Amazon Recruiters, I finally responded to one on May 30th 2022.
He connected me with his recruiting partner and a couple weeks later she asked me to apply to an official job posting.

Here is the resume I used:

So it goes to show that you don't always need a single-page resume to get into big tech.


== Online Assessment

After submitting my application on soon after, I received my email from Amazon for the next step in the process.
I was given a week after getting the acceptance email from Amazon to complete an online assessment.
The online assessment consisted of two coding assessment questions (Leetcode style), a work simulation, and a work style assessment.
I finished the online assessment on June 22nd.

=== Preparation

I had begun practicing on link:https://leetcode.com/[Leetcode] about the same time I responded to the recruiter.
Before doing the online assessment, I had done about 10 easy questions, and  about 10 medium ones; roughly one or two questions a day.
It was pretty hard at first, but I saw significant improvement, taking about half an hour to an hour to do the medium questions before doing my online assessment.
I also paid for the premium version for the duration of this process, which I think was worth it.

=== Coding Assessment

For the coding assessment, I was given an online IDE, on which I could pick from many different languages.
I was then given two questions to solve in 1 hour, I could switch between the two whenever I wanted.
Each question also had several test cases and I could submit my solution to see how many test cases I passed.
It would only provide the inputs and outputs for a few of the test cases though, so much of the edge case handling is up to the writer to ponder.

In the acceptance email, I got a link to the assessment as well as a demo one.
I thought I'd be able to try the demo as many times as I could, so I opened it up right away and tried it out a bit closing it.
I wanted to do an actual practice run later, but to my dismay, it was then closed.

I didn't ace the coding assessment.
For the first question, I did pass all the test cases after about 30 minutes.
For the second question, I only passed all the logical cases but I didn't write an optimal solution so I didn't pass the runtime cases.
The optimal solution required dynamic programming and I didn't have time to do the caching.
I thought for this reason I wouldn't get past this round, but apparently, it's enough.

=== Work Simulation

The work simulation was a series of multiple choice questions.
The question would come as a mock email from a coworker, and I was given some choices on how to respond to them.
The questions were not behavioural but mostly about work style and technical skills.

As an example, on one end of the spectrum, I was asked how I would begin prototyping a new product.
The choices were similar to: gathering requirements, start building the prototype, or start drawing high-level design diagrams.

On the other end of the spectrum, I was asked to choose the best database, choosing between the likes of PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, or MongoDB.

There were definitely some technical questions I wasn't very knowledgeable of, like database selection. There was no time limit for this step, it took me about 20 minutes.

=== Work Style Assessment

In this one, I was given statements such as, _"I sometimes feel uncomfortable in new situations"_ and I was then asked to select how much I agreed to the statement in a multiple choice manner ranging from "Strongly Agree" to "Strongly Disagree".

These were obviously to assess how much my personality matched link:https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles[Amazon's Leadership Principles].
I could've studied them to answer them to get the job, but I answered mostly truthfully.

There was no time limit for this step, it also took me about 20 minutes.

== Phone Screening

I got feedback on my online assessment quickly.
A couple days later, I got an email congratulating me and wanting to schedule me for a phone screening.
It wasn't actually going to be via phone but through Amazon Chime, their custom video calling software, similar to Skype.

It originally got scheduled for early July, but due to a conflict, I rescheduled it for mid July.
The rescheduling process was relatively painless and smooth.

=== Question Two

The phone screening was a whiteboard coding session consisting of two questions over 60 minutes.
I would connect via Amazon Chime and we'd join a live coding session where we both connected to an online IDE, but it was more or less just a collaborative notepad.

The first question was a Leetcode style question.
It was a relatively easy level Leetcode question using binary trees.
I solved it, but originally with an incorrect approach of a BFS approach.
My interviewer quickly corrected me to using a recursive DFS approach, which panicked me at first since I always shied away from recursive solutions.
But I did end up solving it in about half an hour, they were pretty uninterested in if my syntax was correct.
I was not asked for the complexity.

=== Question Two

The second question was an object-oriented design type of question.
I was asked to design the parking meter for a parking garage.
I think the key design issue was on whether to have a configurable class or an interface, in this case, for setting a pricing model.
Overall I was pretty unsure of myself and I think the interviewer had to continuously reaffirm that I was moving in the right direction.

=== Phone Screening After Thoughts

I think as a developer, I am particularly strong in object-oriented design which I think shown in this interview.
There were definitely mistakes though, mistakes that the interviewer had to correct, so this was by no means a perfect interview.

== The Loop / "On-Site" Interview

I also got feedback on my phone interview quickly.
Just the following day, I had been told I was being moved to the final rounds.
After researching online, I came to know that this interview was known as The Loop.

The Loop consisted of four interviews, for me I asked to schedule them all in one day.
Which they scheduled me to have it a few weeks after my last bit of feedback.

Each interview started with 2 behavioural questions based on Amazon's leadership principles, these took about 20-30 minutes each.
They were then followed by one technical question.
In the overviews below, I will only go over the technical portion.

=== Preparation

In preparation, I did a few more medium Leetcode questions, about 5 more.
I also spent time preparing for the behavioural questions.
To do that, I compiled 10 stories in the link:https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/in-person-interview[STAR format].
Then I got a friend who had passed the Amazon interview to mock interview me.
I had him ask me a question for each leadership principle to make sure I had an answer for them.
He said my answers seemed fine, so I ended my prep for the behavioural aspect there.

=== Interview One

The technical question in the first interview was an object-oriented design question.
We finished early and took the time to implement one of the classes, which I did, but stumbled through a bit more than I think was necessary, it was pretty easy but I had a very silly bug.
Overall, I was pretty happy with how this one went.

=== Interview Two

I felt like I did the worst in this interview.
This was a Leetcode style question that had two steps, first to precache a number of entries, then use that to do a recursive search in a graph for a list of entries.
For half an hour, it seemed a little difficult in my opinion.

I came up with the conceptual solution fairly quickly but I was struggling a bit through the implementation because I kept looking at the time and getting tripped up.
I got to the final step of just writing the recursive function and I just couldn't do it, my mind was a mess.
In the last 5 minutes, he said that we can stop and I can ask him questions.
Or, in his words, we can go to "a super high-pressure scenario" and I can try to finish the problem.
I felt really close, and I think when he said that it gave me a moment to reset.
I finished it in the last 5 minutes and gave him a complexity (that I think was wrong) with no time to spare.

=== Interview Three

This interview had the high-level system design question.
If you hadn't noticed, I didn't study at all for this one.
I was stumbling through it and the interviewer had to keep guiding me on what to design next.
At this point, I didn't have any industry experience in this area, but I felt like I generally knew what I was talking about but just didn't know where to go.

I wasn't sure what to make of this one, at the end he said "You did good!" before quickly leaving, but they're not supposed to give feedback so I took that with a grain of salt.
But viewing some mock system design interviews afterwards, it was clear I did not do what was generally expected.

=== Interview Four

I totally crushed this last one.
This question was two parts and I finished them both quickly.
The first part was a Leetcode style problem that was again a recursive search through a graph.
This was similar to the first question, so I did it very quickly, he also asked for the complexity which I think I answered correctly.
The second part was an object-oriented design question on how I would implement it in a larger system.
I had done something very similar at a previous company so I was able to give a very thorough explanation of good and bad ways to do it, to which he was satisfied.
We finished quite early and I was given a lot of time to ask him questions.

=== The Loop After Thoughts

I felt like there were a a few places I could've been knocked, so I was very nervous about the results right after the final interview.
The areas I felt nervous about:

* In all my coding/Leetcode assessments, I made some significant mistakes, or was slow.
* I didn't study the leadership principles very hard, I was just answering the questions and hoping my stories displayed the leadership principles.
I could've been more confident if I felt like I was always answering to a specific leadership principle.
* I didn't know how the system design interview went.

So I was nervous about basically every aspect, except in object-oriented design.
But in the end, only one of those ended up being an actual issue.

== The Offer

Amazon promises to provide feedback within 5 business days.
I got an email from my recruiter 2 business after my final interview.
Unfortunately, I read online that one of their KPIs is to provide verbal feedback.
So the email had no and was no indication of how I did, it was just asking me to schedule a call to discuss that.
I had the call the day after and was met with bitter-sweet news.
The team liked me, and that I did well in every aspect, except the system design, which made sense; I didn't study for that one at all.
But it meant that the interview I thought I did the worst on, the second one, actually went fine.

So they wanted to give me an offer but downlevel me to an SDE I role, the original role I was interviewing for was an SDE II role.
This was quite a failure on my part because I think if I studied the system design interview, I could've passed that as well.
After looking at mock system design interviews online, it was definitely something I could've done well.

Now the team I interviewed with wasn't hiring SDE Is, so my recruiter scheduled calls for me with hiring managers from other teams.
I didn't have to do any additional interviews, just talk with the hiring managers.
This whole conversation took almost a month but I got a finalized offer letter on August 30th with a start date of Sept 26th.

== Conclusion

The interview is very studyable, so I think any developer who puts their mind to it could probably pass the interview with enough studying.
Although the amount of studying required would vary heavily depending on the skill of the developer and how closely their personality already matched Amazon's leadership principles.
But one also does not have to perfectly ace every interview, in almost every step I had some significant mistakes.

As far as their communication goes, it exceeded my expectations.
I got all my feedback within 2 business days and I was never lost as to what was happening next.
They also provided me with many resources on how to study for the interviews in each email.

Online, there were a lot of horror stories about the Amazon interview process, especially older ones.
So I think Amazon has put a lot of effort into improving it, and it shows.
Contrary to the big tech interview stereotype, it wasn't just smashing out a bunch of leetcode.
I felt like the assessment methods varied in many ways, most of which were applicable to the job.
For me, the process was very smooth, logical, and enjoyable, 10/10.
