== Ingredients

* 1 Zucchini
* 1 Yam
* 1/2 a White Onion
* Salt
* Pepper
* Thyme
* Olive Oil

== Utensils

* Pan with a cover
* Cutting board
* Knife

== Instructions

=== Preparing the Zucchini and Yam

* Cut the Zucchini and Yam into Slices
* Quarter the Yam and Zucchini Slices, smaller slices can just be cut in half

=== Preparing the Onion

* Cut the Onion in half (the way that doesn't cut the root)
* Cut off the two ends
* Cut the onion length-wise (from one root to the other)

=== Pan-frying

* Pour about a tablespoon of oil
* Preheat the pan to a medium and high heat
* When pan is hot, add vegetables, stirring to spread out the oil
* Layer vegetables evenly
* Sprinkle salt, pepper, and thyme on top
* Put on lid but leave and opening for moisture to escape
* Stir once every couple minutes until vegetables are charred

== Notes

* When shopping, since you can't buy half an onion, the shopping list should be 2 zucchinis, 2 yams, and 1 onion. But still only pan fry the amount listed in the recipe or the pan will be too crowded to cook the vegetables evenly.
* When buying yams, buy yams similar to shape to a Zucchini so after cutting their sizes will be similar.
