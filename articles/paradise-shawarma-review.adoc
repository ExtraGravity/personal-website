The link:http://www.paradiseshawarma.ca/[Paradise Shawarma] I went to was located at link:https://g.page/paradise-shawarma-Woodbridge?share[5451 Hwy 7 Unit#10, Woodbridge, ON L4L 0B2].
It was open late (11:30pm) so it was a good late night option, which was when I went.
The service was quite slow, I waited about 20 minutes for one shawarma wrap, but the staff was quite friendly and casual.
The overall atmosphere of the place was like a fast food joint from the early 2000s, so a bit rundown.
I'll be rating the food here based on my 5-tier system, which you can read about on my link:/reviews[reviews] page.

== Items Ordered

I had the Beef Shawarma wrap with all toppings (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles) and garlic sauce.
I opted out of the tahini sauce and hot sauce.
Overall the taste would be an *OK*, it was a little on the bland side; I wasn't hit with the array of spices I would normally expect from shawarma.
That said there was certainly nothing _wrong_ with the taste.

The wrapping and how it was toasted was perfect though.
The wrap stayed together really well and had the perfect balance of flexibility and crunch.
This pushed the rating up to a *GOOD*.
