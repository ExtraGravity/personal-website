The link:TODO[Ramen Isshin] I went to was located at link:TODO[421 College St. Toronto, ON M5T 1T1].
It was quite busy and they really capitalize on that by limiting sitting time at a table to 60 minutes.
They're not rude at all about that though and it is ample time to enjoy the meal.

When I first walked in, it reminded me very much of the ramen shops in Japan, so the atmosphere they really hit the nail on the head.
The staff were particularly pleasant and our waiter was very helpful in giving me recommendations.
I really like noodle soups but ramen is probably near the bottom of the list of noodle soups for me, even then I think the ramen here stood-out comparison to other ramen shops I've been to.
I'll be rating the food here based on my 5-tier system, which you can read about on my link:/reviews[reviews] page.

== Dishes

=== TODO

Per the waiter's recommendation, I ordered the TODO.
This was a bit unique as far as noodle soups go since the soup all came on the side in a stone bowl.
I think the way it's intended to be eaten is to take some noodles and dip it into the soup.
Please link:/contact[contact me] if I'm wrong!
Usually I find in western ramen shops the noodles feel a bit cheap and not much of a step up from instant noodle packs.
The noodles here though had a nice solid texture to them and did an excellent job of absorbing the rich flavours of the soup.
The soup itself was very strongly flavoured so it did well as a dip.
The egg was perfectly cooked and well infused with a savoury flavour.
The only thing I think I might've changed is for the meat to be better seasoned, there was nothing wrong with it but I think a bit more care to have it stand out would've added a lot to the dish.
All in all, everything but the meat was excellent, that small possible improvement leaves this dish as a *GOOD* from me.

=== Mango Pudding

I was very pleased with the execution of the ramen so I wanted to try some of their dessert as well.
The whole bowl had a light delicate texture that I want from desserts. The flavour had just enough mango and sweetness that the mango was highlighted and complimented but nothing was overpowering.
This was definitely among some of the best mango pudding that I've had, I'm delighted to tell you that this dessert was *GREAT*.
