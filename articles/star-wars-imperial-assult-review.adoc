Me and some friends did a playthrough of https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-imperial-assault/[Star Wars Imperial Assault] and had a real blast.
The game is a campaign split into 11-14 missions which each took us about 1.5-3 hours each.
The gameplay was solid, stories well written, and the progress between each mission felt great.
1-4 players play the side of the Rebel Forces and 1 person gets to control the Imperial Forces.
Each mission ends with either the Rebel Forces or the Imperial Forces being the victor, which comes with a larger set of spoils in preperation for the next mission.

The game requires a bit of a gamemaster, which would be whoever is playing as the Imperial Forces.
The person playing as the Imperial Forces needs to be read up on the mission ahead of time since there are many surprises for the Rebel Forces throughout the missions.
Depending on how the game is going as well, that person would probably tweak the difficulty as they play to help or hinder the Rebel Forces to keep the game balanced.

We spent just shy of a year completing the campaign averaging around 1 campaign per month.
That's just how it ended up with all our schedules but I don't think I would've change the pace even if we had more time.

== Gameplay Overview

Each mission is split up into rounds, approximately 8, and within each round the Rebel Forces and Imperial Forces take turns controlling their characters.
Each player of the Rebel Forces choose one character at the beginning of the campaign

== Conclusion

Star Wars Imperial Assault is an excellent campaign board game.
The overall tactile quality of the game is excellent, the pieces are well designed, beautiful and practical.
