			I was invited to build the website for the 2017 <a href="http://cfes.ca/events-and-services/cec/">Canadian Engineering Competition</a> by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christine-cao-88b06a63/">Christine Cao</a> who was the project chair.
			The site has since been taken down but I have been allowed to host it on a different port for portfolio purposes.
			<br><br>
			This was a great learning experience for me to work with people who didn't know how the background of websites 
			worked.
			This was a great experience for me to explain the explore business concepts and mediate deadlines and expectations between myself and various stakeholders.
			I had the option use a website builder such as WordPress for this project, but I decided to challenge myself to build a website from scratch that could look just as good as any website builder.
			<br><br>
			Athough there are areas that could have been improved, my clients as well as myself were quite happy with the overall aesthetic.

			This project invovled designing and writing all the software for the custom built embedded systems going into the 5th Generation Solar Car.
			This was particularly exciting for me because it was the first time I really had a chance to work on actual embedded systems and all their intracacies.g1
			The picture may be slightly misleading as I didn't do any of the hardware design, but I designed and coded all the software.
			The hardware design was all overseen by the extremely talented <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/logan-hunter-75309999/">Logan Hunter</a>.
			<br><br>
			The software stack is built on top of the STM32 libraries.
			The code was first intialized using <a href="http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html">STM32CubeMX</a>, then a Makefile generated using <a href="https://github.com/baoshi/CubeMX2Makefile">CubeMX2Makefile</a>, then cross compiled with <a href="https://github.com/adamgreen/gcc4mbed">gcc4mbed</a>.
			We have a <a href="https://github.com/UCSolarCarTeam/Recruit-Resources/tree/master/Development-Guide/Compile-and-Flash-STMBoard-Guide">guide</a> to use this stack if you so wish yourself.
			<br><br>
			On top having experience setting up an embedded systems development environment, I wrote a lot of code surrounding a CAN network, the industry standard protcol for communications within an automobile.
			I also learned a great deal about sharing resources in a multi task environment with FreeRTOS.
			Overall, I now feel comfortable coding in pure C and working with low level concepts such as registers and limited memory.

			<h2>Terminal Fighter</h2>

			Terminal Fighter is a typing game written in Python3.
			This was a passion project with a few friends that I pursued and is still in development.
			What I have shown below is the finished prototype, a finished product will be quite large in scope, I don't expect it to be done for a while.
			If you want to try it out you can run terminalfighter.py using Python3, you will need pygame which can be installed for Python3 with <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/401342/how-to-download-pygame-in-python3-3">these instructions</a>.
			Pres 1 and 2 to switch weapons!
			<br><br>
			I love typing games and I had always wanted to try making one as games are a unique development experience.
			This project gave me very good opportunities to challenge and practice many object oriented concepts.
			This is due to the large amount of objects that are similar yet different, and also must be constantly created and destroyed.
			I also was able to design a game loop and see how different designs affected the game in different ways.
			We also faced the bottleneck of SDL1 which did not take advantage of the graphics card, the next iteration is in C++ and using SDL2.
			This next step has me very excited to even further improve my object oriented design intuition and also stretch the capabilites SDL2 has to offer.
			<br><br>
			Overall although the graphics are quite simple, I'm very happy with the gameplay result as it has very few bugs (that I've found anyways).
			Games, although commonly looked down upon in development, I think are extremely fun to develop and pose many difficult and unique challenges.

			This project involves receiving data on a Desktop via a USB radio and displaying it in a rich user interface.
			This was my first real completed project and I was under the guidance of the very talented <a href="http://jordanheinrichs.com/">Jordan Heinrichs</a>.
			<br><br>
			The project is built on the QT framework, from this project a large majority of the work in the Solar Car Team is now also done in QT.
			This project really kickstarted my love for software development and showed me what it really meant to design modular object oriented software.
			I also realized from this project how much I loved making user interfaces.
