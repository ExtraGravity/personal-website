		My friend (Mohammed) and I play a lot of co-op games together and this is our ratings of them.
		The hours column is how many hours we played it together.
		Some of them are a "?" because we added this column later and we couldn't find how many hours we played it.

					<b>Enoch:</b> Took us about 30hrs to do most of the content, so not super long, but that said, great shooting mechanics, lots of variability, and tons of fun. I think overall the idea is not that complicated, but it's executed very well, all the mechanics just feel so solid and great to play. If you aren't into shooters, I feel like it might not provide you much, but if you're into shooters at all this is prime shooting. One of the best things about the game is that I never felt like my deaths were bullshit. I think only more content is keeping this from a 10.
				<br>
				<br>
					<b>Mohammed:</b> If you're itching for some borderlands gameplay but as a rogue-lite, this is the game for you. The game is a looter shooter with a well balanced difficulty curve and very satisfying gun-play. The builds are fun but as you play more and grind out some of the harder difficulties, build variety falls off (elemental builds seemed much better than anything else). Overall a very well polished and refined experience if you're looking for some fun shooting and looting. My only other gripe was that the multiplayer doesn't do a great job of feeling like a cooperative experience. There's no way for allies to really help each other or synergize builds together.

					<b>Enoch:</b> This was the best survival crafting game I've played, excellent build tree with fun and wacky upgrades Getting supplies was also fun and not tedious, hard thing to do. The level design also always made moving to the next area feel fresh and exciting. I do wish the cooking and fishing were more impactful to the game though, examples of that would be cooking in Valheim and fishing in Stardew Valley. It's the best survival crafting game I've ever played, but why is it only an 8 you might ask? Cause of the ending, last warning for spoilers. The ending leaves a sour taste that all you were doing was for nothing, and you actually ended up doing a horrible thing but you had no agency to choose otherwise.
				<br>
				<br>
					<b>Mohammed:</b> This is the best survival crafting game I've played, hands down. It has some of the best level design in video games I've ever played. Each level is large, unique, and full of new things to explore, but is designed in a way that when you come back to it, it's familiar and very easy to get around. Resource gathering is fun, even going back to get prior resources isn't tedious like in most other survival games I've played. The crafting develops in a fun way with good options that allow to slowly build and upgrade your base at just the right pace. The atmosphere of the game is both funny/goofy with a splash of creepy in just the right places. Readers of SCP in particular will enjoy reading through the log files. The ending puts a bit of a damper on things, but I would highly recommend this game both alone or with a friend.

					<b>Enoch:</b> This game is so highly acclaimed, but I just couldn't put my finger on why I didn't like it that much. There is an insane amount of freedom given to the player, with fleshed out storylines and an in-depth fighting system. I think I just wasn't that attached to the story, and it's a story driven game. Also with no DnD experience, I felt like it took me a while to understand the combat mechanics, the game doesn't do a great job of explaining it.
				<br>
				<br>
					<b>Mohammed:</b> Considered by many the crown jewels of modern RPGs, and they're probably right. This game does complexity and gameplay just right, with an excellent balance of intricate classes but combats that aren't too slow and bogged down (see Wartales for comparison). Controversially, I didn't develop the same connection to the other party members that many other people seem to and was less interested in their stories, although maybe this is because I played with friends using our custom characters. On a second playthrough, some of the smoke and mirrors of the story decisions becomes more obvious though. As a lover of Dragon Age Origins, this game brings back some nostalgia.

					<b>Enoch:</b> I was pretty close to putting this game at 7. There were a lot of rough edges, but it definitely did a lot of things great as well. One major issue was the number of bugs, including some particularly frustrating ones where we had to restart or lost saves. But on the other hand, it did combat pretty well from a design perspective; it was a great co-op experience that was fun and balanced. It also had some pretty great storylines. The overall plot was good, but I couldn't say it was totally gripping, but there were definitely some amazing gasp or literally LOL moments. Along that line, the story would've probably been better if there were more close-ups or better voice acting to feel closer to the characters. This is a low 8, pretty close to a 7 for me, but if it had more polish it would've been a 9.
				<br>
				<br>
					<b>Mohammed:</b> Imagine Baldur's Gate 3 gameplay in a Fallout setting (but don't expect the same level of production value). Overall a very unique RPG experience and I would highly recommend it to RPG enjoyers looking for a change of scenery. I thoroughly enjoyed the gameplay and story, although the game was held back by a few bugs that caused us to have to repeat several hours of gameplay. Personally for me the leveling and skill trees could've been a little more complex.

					<b>Enoch:</b> Everything standard in the survival crafting genre, it had, and it had it polished. But I think one of its biggest issues is that it was too hard to get around. There was a lot to explore, but going somewhere always felt like a bit of a chore due to the lack of transportation methods. It had ziplines, but they were fairly difficult to setup, which has its place, but other options also would've been nice. The end game also felt a bit too similar to the rest of the game, it would've benefited from new combat mechanics being introduced later in the game.
				<br>
				<br>
					<b>Mohammed:</b> Grounded overall is a well-polished and fun crafting survival game, but as time goes on, the experience begins to drag a little and game slightly overstays its welcome. This is a rare example of a game that I felt would be better with less content, as much of it felt liike grinding and padding to look for the 68th crafting ingredient among a long list of very similar enemies. I didn't feel the story or the combat were engaging enough to keep me entertained for the full run time, and I feel like a tighter more streamlined experience might have been better.

					<b>Enoch:</b> I think Abyssus is pretty well made, with interesting bosses, abilities, unlockables and weapons. I think I just had a bit of a lack of visual clarity in general. It was hard to link how the builds were affecting the damage output, and I often felt I didn't understand what I took damage from; which I'm saying I felt a large lack of visual clarity. Maybe I'm just a boomer who doesn't understand the game, but it's hard to give it a really enjoyable experience for me even though the game is quite polished.

				<br>
				<br>
					<b>Mohammed:</b> Abyssus is another game in a recent trend of rogue-lite looter shooters. I found it overall fun with satisfying boss fights and interesting and unique guns, although I think the game suffers from a lack of content. I feel most rogue-lites lose a lot of luster when you finish them the first time, and for this game that point comes too early. More guns and more upgrades would've added a lot. That being said, I felt the shooting was immensely satisfying and the gameplay managed to carry much of the experience.

					<b>Enoch:</b> This game was really fun it was beautiful and the controls were great. I really want to note the amazing visual clarity in the game, for other games with a lot of going on I find sometimes it was hard to understand why I died sometimes, but I rarely felt my deaths were unfair. There were interesting upgrades and abilities, but I think maybe there was a lack of interactions between the items that made the game become a bit stale after a dozen or so runs. So while the game was great, I enjoyed it probably as much as the other 8s on this list, there just wasn't enough content/replayability to put it at an 8.
				<br>
				<br>
					<b>Mohammed:</b> Another fun entry in the rogue-lite shooter with fun builds category but now with a twist (the twist is that its top down view). I found this game quite fun and the characters all play differently, although the builds feel a little limited (your two choices are mostly on-hit and melee burn). My biggest gripe with the game is its just a little too short, and the content very quickly feels repetitive. Thankfully the gameplay loop is fun enough to carry this game through its short run-time.

				<br>
				<br>
					<b>Mohammed:</b> Overall this is pretty great if you're looking for coop stealth, and there are lots of ways to challenge yourselves (we did collect all thieves tokens). The game tries to introduce new mechanics every level, but still starts to feel a little stale towards the end.

					<b>Enoch:</b> The game really did what it was going for, you're controlling a band of mercenaries where people die sometimes. You have to manage your food and finances, which I think was a bit too punishing. Losing people was also much more punishing than allowed for a I think the intended experience, it really resulted in only taking easy fights that you could dominate. There was also a fair amount of coop bugs, which forced a lot of restarts, in the end a game breaking bug also ended our run. Your troop also ends up getting very big, so every engagement ends up being very long and begins to feel tedious. But for all its flaws, I looked forward to playing it and had a great coop experience with Mohammed, discussing how to manage our troop and strategize our fights was very fun.
				<br>
				<br>
					<b>Mohammed:</b> Where do I even start with this game? We played it a long time and yet I can't say I loved it. It does truly capture the feeling of being "mercenary band simulator". The combat resembles a simplified, more grounded turn based gameplay similar to BG3 and Wastleland 3, but people who enjoy the more fantastical aspects of these games may be disappointed. That being said, the combat is highly tactical with a lot of decision making. I found the story somewhat drab and uninteresting, being mostly a loosely connected series of jobs (as may be typical of a mercenary group). If you like slow turn based gameplay and careful resource management you may like this game, however combat can feel like a long slog sometimes, where each fight takes 30 minutes but feels like it only minimally advances the story. Unfortunately, a plethora of bugs do plague the game, one of which essentially prevented us from advancing the story.

					<b>Enoch:</b> Beautiful graphics with a lot going on, interesting weapons and a decently long campaign. But somehow I don't like this game as much as I think I should, I think I came in hoping for a bit of a factory game, but I guess really it plays more like a PvE Starcraft where you can plop stuff down wherever. I think the gameplay felt too monotonous because it was just plopping stuff down and shooting without any problem solving, and the combat got stale because it was always just dumb enemies running at you, except they get bigger.
				<br>
				<br>
					<b>Mohammed:</b> I think I was misled to think this was a Factorio like game (not necessarily the game's fault) when in reality it's much more of an RTS/tower defense genre. The game is incredibly well polished, it looks beautiful, and you can tell they put tons of effort into the enemy and environment design. Personally I felt the combat a little lack luster, and overall the research tree and resource gathering felt repetitive.

					<b>Enoch:</b> The game looks so good, really polished to a T, lots of elements of coop games that I like, but somehow it just didn't do it for me. I think there wasn't quite enough freedom in base building, getting resources to build I think was a little harder than I would've liked. Maybe I just don't like boss fights in these kinds of games that are more about mechanics than preparation.

I thought it was a great vampire simulator, the sun avoidance and kidnapping villages was well done, and I liked the feeling of hunting down and slaying powerful foes to steal their abilities. The combat was fun and I felt the boss fights gave a significant challenge. The basebuilding wasn't as positive, feeling kinda slow and many of the recipes have long crafting/wait times. I heard adjustment of server settings helps with this problem but we played the game with native settings. I'd recommend this to anyone who really wants a "vampire in the wild" experience.

					<b>Enoch:</b> The game starts off so strong, a fun tutorial, gripping beginning, and a ton of fun mechanics. But I think I just felt "too strong" later? There was a lot of feel of danger at first, being a drug dealer, running from the cops, not enough money for everything. But all those went away at some point and the game loses its charm.
				<br>
				<br>
					<b>Mohammed:</b> I feel conflicted about this game. While it has a very strong start, and a satisfying gameplay loop, somewhere in the mid game it loses me. I didn't feel the game did anything particularly wrong, but ultimately I didn't feel very driven to keep pushing into the content.

					<b>Enoch:</b> Very intense game with a beautiful cute-anime aesthetic. It did a great job of bringing co-op into the bullet hell genre with unique enemies and characters to mix and match with. Unfortunately, I think I sucked too much at the game to really enjoy it to its fullest. If someone finds it's their kind of game, it's definitely something you'd sink countless hours into, but I think the gameplay mechanics lack mass appeal.
				<br>
				<br>
					<b>Mohammed:</b> Maybe I'm just not a huge fan of bullet hells but this game didn't quite do it for me. The varying classes were fun and playing with friends does lead to fun learning and cooperation, but it's not a game I felt compelled to continue playing to learn the highest level of boss mechanics.

					<b>Enoch:</b> Hilarious concept, it's "Getting Over It" but you're a fish out of water. The controls fit the vibe, and we dedicated some good hours trying to get as high as we could. The checkpoint system wasn't very clear, but once we understood it was a fair addition to this type of game. Well-made, but not my kind of game. I'm sure if it had some more marketing it could've built a strong dedicated fandom.
				<br>
				<br>
					<b>Mohammed:</b> This is definitely a "we have nothing to do for 2 hours today" kinda game. We had some laughs watching each other fall down the mountain, but overall it's not a game that's likely to keep your attention for very long. If you really like intentionally clunky platformers you may like this, but otherwise it's mostly a meme than a full game. Also it doesn't feel like a real co-op experience, as the addition of extra players doesn't alter your own gameplay in any way.

					<b>Enoch:</b> This game is like overcooked, but with really frustrating controls. Choosing what to pick up was really difficult, putting down the tent, which you have to do every round, was excruciatingly painful, and not being able to stop the squirrels from taking your resources felt so unfair. I'm also just really not a fan of the comic-style graphics, and rarely do I feel a game's sound design was annoying but many sound effects were really like scratching a chalkboard to me.
				<br>
				<br>
					<b>Mohammed:</b> This is an overcooked style game that misses the mark. I didn't feel the levels added enough variety to the gameplay, and each level feels kinda samey pretty fast. Imagine if overcooked had way less charm and a lot more clunkiness.

					<b>Enoch:</b> Game seems to have quite a bit of bugs. We often saw different weights for the boxes, and we bought upgrades but never figured out how to use them. There also seemed to be levels that we could progress through, but we couldn't figure out how to do them in multiplayer, we always got randomly generated levels no matter how we selected it. I think the game concept is actually not bad, but either there's a lot of bugs, or there's a lot of explaining to be done. Actually regardless, there's a lot of explaining that needs to be done.
				<br>
				<br>
					<b>Mohammed:</b> This feels more like a tech demo designed to practice physics than a real game, and the free to play status probably reflects that. The multiplayer is unbaked and while there are levels to play through we couldn't do it as coop so you're left with basically a single level of endless mode. A bug also caused me to crash and lose all multiplayer progress. It's an experience that is unfortunately quite dull so even the one hour played felt like a waste.

					<b>Mohammed:</b> There was some hype around this game on steam, but neither of us really understood it. Supposedly it calls back to some OG dungeon crawler games that perhaps we're not boomer enough to appreciate. Overall a somewhat slow and clunky game with an outdated art style.

		I like to keep track of the places I eat at and I also have a systematic way of ranking food as well.
		I only rate the food; not the prices, atmosphere, or service, because it is the food that will get me coming back.
		This system is also not linear on a scale of 1-10, for example an *OK* restaurant would be around a 6/10, not 4/10.
		The following is how I rank food:
	</p>
	<ul class="system-list">
		<li >
			<p class='system-label'>Bad</p>
			<p>
				This is food that does not taste good even if I'm hungry, it would either be bland or have some kind of unpleasant flavor.
				Food can range from bad to absolutely terrible, but I don't think separating those are useful.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p class='system-label'>Ok</p>
			<p>
				Most food lands in this category, it still tastes really good if I'm hungry.
				Although I would not grumble if this was suggested among friends, there are obvious improvements to be made.
				This doesn't mean the place is below average though, on a scale of 1-10 this is something like a 6.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p class='system-label'>Good</p>
			<p>
				When I think food is good, that means it's above average, but there are still subtle things that could be improved.
				This is the kind of place I'd go to regularly if I lived close by.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p class='system-label'>Great</p>
			<p>
				Great food is perfectly executed and as great as I could imagine it.
				This is the kind of place I'd go to often if I lived in the same city.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p class='system-label'>AMAZING</p>
			<p>
				This means I did not know this kind of food could be this good.
				It was perfectly executed and showed me a side of food beyond my imagination.
				If I was visiting the area, I would make sure to go here.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		I'm not a professional cook or anything, just a self-proclaimed foodie.
		I also keep track of the date here because a restaurant's quality can change a lot over time.
		For the AMAZING locations, I've also included my favourite menu item in hopes you'd order it too!

		This is a collection of reviews for anime I've watched.
		That said, this list is as biased as you could get towards my personal tastes, so don't expect objective opinions here.
		For rating anime, I think in a very compartmentalized way, so in the same fashion, I have a specific system.
		I rank them in 3 different categories out of 5: Premise, Plot, and Execution.
		<ul class="system-list">
			<li>
				<p class='system-label'>Premise</p>
				<p>
					This would be the elevator pitch, the whole idea behind the anime.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class='system-label'>Plot</p>
				<p>
					This is how the story is written, including characters, kind of how it'd be as a novel.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class='system-label'>Execution</p>
				<p>
					This is everything else, from the visuals, and the moment to moment dynamic.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		I would recommend anything on here that has a 5 in any category, regardless of the other ratings.

					This is my favourite anime, I loved the deep level of mystery in the premise; any anime that successfully creates a novel world has at least a 4 in terms of premise.
					The plot was probably the biggest seller to me, rewatching Reiner, Bertholt, and Annie's dialogue after knowing their background was mind-blowing.
					A mixture of action in the titan fights and the delivery of each character's motivations is what gives it a 5 in execution.
					<br></br>
					The only thing that kept this anime from a perfect score was the ending.
					In my opinion, the ending wasn't bad, it just didn't live up to the rest of the anime.
					It was a little hand-wavy in terms of sci-fi magic and just didn't contain the same level of grit and conflict as the rest of the anime.

					This one is a bit unlike most of the other anime I've watched here.
					I think the premise of a couple bonding together over making cosplays was pretty fresh.
					The plot itself is pretty boring overall I'd say, it just goes through a couple's love story without a lot of conflict, but it does make it easy to watch.
					<br></br>
					Although if you really strip down the plot itself, I think it is boring; but it didn't make it unenjoyable to watch.
					The delivery of the characters' dialogues was sentimental and impactful; that, and I think the fan-service was solid and inserted at logical times.

					Tower of God drops us into a unique world that is totally unlike life as we know it, with the entire population's lives enamored by climbing the tower.
					And in this unique world, we also follow one of the greatest anomalies the tower has ever seen, leading to an intriguing and thoughtful premise.
					The plot is also quite good.
					We follow Baam who is chasing after a friend, while that sounds a little corny (looking at you Naruto), it makes sense considering Baam's original situation.
					The plot is strengthened by the many imaginative and interesting characters we meet along the way, along with the creative and thought-provoking stages throughout the tower.
					<br></br>
					Unfortunately, I think the anime adaptation was a bit lacking in the execution department.
					I felt that the animation was lackluster compared to the extragance of the tower, but I think it's hard to match up to the modern-day juggernauts like Demon Slayer.
					As a preface, I read most of the manhwa before watching the anime adaptation.
					With what's coming up, I hope the animation picks up and the studios get more budget to give the grandiose beauty that Tower of God will deserve.
