	<h1>Food</h1>

	<p>
		I like to keep track of the places I eat at and I also have a systematic way of ranking food as well.
		I only rate the food; not the prices, atmosphere, or service, because it is the food that will get me coming back.
		This system is also not linear on a scale of 1-10, for example an *OK* restaurant would be around a 6/10, not 4/10.
		The following is how I rank food:
	</p>
	<ul class="system-list">
		<li >
			<p class='system-label'>Bad</p>
			<p>
				This is food that does not taste good even if I'm hungry, it would either be bland or have some kind of unpleasant flavor.
				Food can range from bad to absolutely terrible, but I don't think separating those are useful.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p class='system-label'>Ok</p>
			<p>
				Most food lands in this category, it still tastes really good if I'm hungry.
				Although I would not grumble if this was suggested among friends, there are obvious improvements to be made.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p class='system-label'>Good</p>
			<p>
				When I think food is good, that means it's above average, but there are still subtle things that could be improved.
				This is the kind of place I'd go to regularly if I lived close by.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p class='system-label'>Great</p>
			<p>
				Great food is perfectly executed and as great as I could imagine it.
				This is the kind of place I'd go to often if I lived in the same city.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p class='system-label'>AMAZING</p>
			<p>
				This means I did not know this kind of food could be this good.
				It was perfectly executed and showed me a side of food beyond my imagination.
				If I was visiting the area, I would make sure to go here.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		I'm not a professional cook or anything, just a self-proclaimed foodie.
		I also keep track of the date here because a restaurant's quality can change a lot over time.
		For the AMAZING locations, I've also included my favourite menu item in hopes you'd order it too!

		This is a collection of reviews for anime I've watched.
		That said, this list is as biased as you could get towards my personal tastes, so don't expect objective opinions here.
		For rating anime, I think in a very compartmentalized way, so in the same fashion, I have a specific system.
		I rank them in 3 different categories out of 5: Premise, Plot, and Execution.
		<ul class="system-list">
			<li>
				<p class='system-label'>Premise</p>
				<p>
					This would be the elevator pitch, the whole idea behind the anime.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class='system-label'>Plot</p>
				<p>
					This is how the story is written, including characters, kind of how it'd be as a novel.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class='system-label'>Execution</p>
				<p>
					This is everything else, from the visuals, and the moment to moment dynamic.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		I would recommend anything on here that has a 5 in any category, regardless of the other ratings.

					This is my favourite anime, I loved the deep level of mystery in the premise; any anime that successfully creates a novel world has at least a 4 in terms of premise.
					The plot was probably the biggest seller to me, rewatching Reiner, Bertholt, and Annie's dialogue after knowing their background was mind blowing.
					A mixture of action in the titan fights and the delivery of each character's motivations is what gives it a 5 in execution.
					<br></br>
					The only thing that kept this anime from a perfect score was the ending.
					In my opinion, the ending wasn't bad, it just didn't live up to the rest of the anime.
					It was a little hand wavy in terms of sci-fi magic and just didn't contain the same level of grit and conflict as the rest of the anime.

					This one is a bit unlike most of the other anime I've watched here.
					I think the premise of a couple bonding together over making cosplays was pretty fresh.
					The plot itself is pretty boring overall I'd say, it just goes through a couple's love story without a lot of conflict, but it does make it easy to watch.
					<br></br>
					Although if you really strip down the plot itself, I think it is boring, but it didn't make it not enjoyable to watch.
					The delivery of the characters' dialogues were sentimental and impactful; that, and I think the fan-service was solid and inserted at logical times.
